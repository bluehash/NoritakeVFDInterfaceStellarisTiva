This project was built for the Noritake CUY100 24*6 VFDusing StellarisWare using a Stellaris Launchpad
Goto http://forum.stellarisiti.com/topic/1817-noritake-vfd-cuy100-246-stellaris-launchpad-interface/ for pictures.
Code was ported from Noritake's Atmel code to Stellaris.

Note that files under utils folder are linked to files under StellarisWare/utils. I cannot add them 
to github, since it will violate the STellarisWare license. But it's free to download from TI.
